# EDA-on-Flight-delay-prediction-using-ML-NaiveBayes

Developed a flight delay prediction project utilizing Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning techniques. 
Conducted EDA using Jupyter Notebook to analyze and visualize flight delay data, identifying patterns and factors contributing to delays.
Trained a Naive Bayes classifier model to predict flight delays with high accuracy.
